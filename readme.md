Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may use the source codes for the development of free and/or 
commercially sold applications. You may also modify the codes and
distribute them.


Distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may freely distribute the source codes from destructor.de. However,
if you distribute the originals, you must distribute all original files
as well.

If you distribute modifications of the *source* codes, these must also be
free.

You must not charge any fees or royalties for the usage of destructor.de 
source codes or their derivates.

Please give credit if you use destructor.de codes. E.g. if you use the
XML Parser, you can state "Created using the destructor.de XML Parser" in
your about box, help file, or readme file.
